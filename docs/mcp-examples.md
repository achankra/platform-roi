# MCP Usage Examples

Common queries and usage patterns for the Platform ROI MCP Server with Claude Desktop and other AI assistants.

## Quick Start Examples

### Basic ROI Calculation
```
Calculate platform engineering ROI for my team
```

```
What's the ROI for platform engineering with 15 developers?
```

### Team-Specific Analysis
```
Calculate platform ROI for a team of 25 engineers at $140k average salary
```

```
My team has 8 developers, we spend 12 hours per week on toil, what's our platform ROI?
```

### Industry-Specific Queries
```
What's the platform engineering ROI for a healthcare company with 20 developers?
```

```
Calculate ROI for financial services - 30 engineers, high technical debt, weekly deployments
```

## Detailed Parameter Examples

### Current Situation Analysis
```
Analyze our current productivity: 12 engineers, $125k average salary, 15 hours weekly toil
```

```
What's our productivity loss with 20 engineers and 10 hours of weekly operational work?
```

### Strategy Comparisons
```
Compare platform strategies for a startup with 15 engineers, expert AI readiness
```

```
Which platform approach is best for healthcare: 40 engineers, medium technical debt, monthly deployments?
```

### AI Maturity Scenarios
```
Compare ROI for AI-native vs hybrid platforms - team already using advanced AI tools
```

```
My team has no AI experience but high willingness to learn, what platform strategy works best?
```

## Complex Scenario Examples

### Large Enterprise
```
Calculate platform ROI for enterprise setup:
- 100 engineers across multiple teams
- Financial services industry 
- Very high technical debt
- Currently no AI usage but intermediate readiness
- Monthly deployments due to compliance
- 5-year analysis horizon
```

### Scale-up Company
```
We're a healthcare startup scaling rapidly:
- Currently 25 engineers, growing to 50
- $150k average salaries
- 20 hours weekly toil (lots of manual processes)
- Basic AI usage (GitHub Copilot)
- High AI readiness team
- Want to deploy daily
- Need 3-year ROI analysis
```

### Legacy Modernization
```
Traditional company modernizing:
- 80 engineers in general tech
- Legacy systems create very high technical debt
- 16 hours weekly toil per engineer
- No current AI usage, low readiness
- Weekly deployments
- Conservative 5-year planning horizon
```

## Comparative Analysis Examples

### AI Strategy Selection
```
Compare platform strategies for the same team configuration:
1. Current state: no AI, high toil
2. Gradual adoption: AI-hybrid approach  
3. Aggressive modernization: AI-native platform

Which delivers the best ROI over 3 years?
```

### Team Size Impact
```
How does ROI change with team size?
- Compare 5 vs 15 vs 50 engineers
- Same parameters otherwise
- Financial services industry
- Medium technical debt
```

### Industry Comparison
```
Same team (20 engineers), different industries:
- General tech company
- Healthcare organization  
- Financial services firm
- Early-stage startup

How do compliance requirements affect platform ROI?
```

## Follow-up Questions

### Diving Deeper into Results
```
Why does AI-native show higher ROI than hybrid for my configuration?
```

```
What are the biggest risk factors for our platform implementation?
```

```
How sensitive is the ROI to changes in technical debt level?
```

### Implementation Planning
```
Based on the ROI analysis, what should our implementation timeline look like?
```

```
What skills do we need to develop for successful AI-native platform adoption?
```

```
How can we reduce our time-to-value from 9 months to 6 months?
```

### Optimization Scenarios
```
If we reduced toil from 12 to 6 hours per week, how would that change the ROI?
```

```
What happens to ROI if we improve our AI readiness from intermediate to high?
```

```
Compare ROI if we increase deployment frequency from weekly to daily
```

## Troubleshooting Examples

### Parameter Clarification
```
What AI readiness level should I choose if my team has used ChatGPT but no coding AI?
```

```
How do I classify our technical debt - we have 5-year-old microservices with some legacy components?
```

### Understanding Results
```
Why is the implementation cost so high for AI-native in financial services?
```

```
Explain the difference between annual benefits and net value in the results
```

## Business Case Examples

### Executive Presentation
```
Create an executive summary of platform ROI for board presentation:
- 60 engineers
- Current annual productivity loss
- Top recommendation with financial projections
- Risk factors and mitigation strategies
```

### Budget Planning
```
We have $500k budget for platform engineering - what's the best approach for 30 engineers in healthcare?
```

```
Break down the first-year costs vs benefits for AI-hybrid platform with 25 developers
```

### Competitive Analysis
```
How does our projected ROI compare to industry benchmarks for similar-sized teams?
```

```
What productivity gains can we expect compared to companies that haven't invested in platform engineering?
```

## Advanced Usage Patterns

### Sensitivity Analysis
```
Run sensitivity analysis:
- Base case: 20 engineers, medium debt
- Optimistic: same team, low debt, high AI readiness
- Pessimistic: same team, high debt, low AI readiness
```

### Multi-year Planning
```
Show year-by-year ROI progression for AI-native platform:
- When do we break even?
- How do benefits ramp up over time?
- What's the 5-year total value?
```

### Risk Assessment
```
What are the main implementation risks for our configuration and how do they affect ROI projections?
```

## Integration with Other Analyses

### DORA Metrics Alignment
```
How do the productivity gains translate to DORA metrics improvements?
```

```
Map the ROI benefits to deployment frequency and lead time reductions
```

### Cost Center Analysis
```
Break down the annual benefits by category:
- Productivity gains from reduced toil
- AI-enhanced development speed
- Deployment frequency improvements
- Operational cost savings
```

## Common Response Patterns

After running calculations, Claude typically provides:

1. **Current situation summary** with productivity loss quantification
2. **Strategy rankings** by ROI with key metrics
3. **Recommendation** based on your specific parameters
4. **Implementation insights** about timeline and complexity
5. **Risk factors** specific to your configuration

Example response structure:
```
Based on your 15-engineer healthcare team with medium technical debt:

Current Situation:
- Annual productivity loss: $468,000 from toil
- Efficiency gap: 20% of team capacity

Recommendation: AI-Enhanced Hybrid Platform
- ROI: +392% over 3 years  
- Net value: $2.1M
- Time to value: 9 months

Key factors: Healthcare compliance requirements increase implementation complexity, but your intermediate AI readiness suggests successful adoption of hybrid approach.
```

## Tips for Better Results

### Be Specific with Context
- Include industry, team experience, and constraints
- Specify current tools and processes

### Ask Follow-up Questions
- Drill into specific aspects of the analysis
- Request scenario comparisons
- Ask for implementation guidance

### Use Iterative Refinement
- Start with basic calculation
- Refine parameters based on initial results
- Compare multiple scenarios
