## Calculation Methodology

### Cost Components

#### Implementation Cost
- Base platform cost (varies by strategy)
- Team implementation effort (weeks √ó 2 FTE √ó loaded salary / 50 weeks)
- Risk multiplier based on industry, technical debt, AI readiness

#### Annual Costs
- Licensing fees (20% of base platform cost)
- Maintenance effort (FTE √ó loaded salary)

### Benefit Components

#### Productivity Gains
- Toil reduction: (toil hours / 40) √ó total team cost √ó reduction factor
- Reduction factors: Open Source (50%), AI-Hybrid (70%), AI-Native (80%)

#### AI Benefits
- Productivity boost: team cost √ó (AI multiplier - current AI gain) √ó 0.8
- Operational savings: team cost √ó AI savings percentage

#### Deployment Value
- Team size √ó $1,500 √ó deployment frequency multiplier

### Multipliers

#### Industry Risk
- General: 1.0x
- Financial: 1.3x
- Healthcare: 1.4x
- Startup: 0.8x

#### Technical Debt Impact
- Low: 0.9x
- Medium: 1.0x
- High: 1.3x
- Very High: 1.6x

#### AI Readiness
- Low: 1.3x
- Intermediate: 1.0x
- High: 0.8x
- Expert: 0.7x

#### Current AI Multiplier
- None: 1.0x
- Basic: 1.15x
- Advanced: 1.35x
- Expert: 1.5x

#### Platform AI Multipliers
- Open Source: 1.0x (no AI enhancement)
- AI-Hybrid: 1.5x productivity multiplier
- AI-Native: 1.75x productivity multiplier

### Time to Value

Time in months before benefits exceed ongoing costs:
- Open Source: 12 months
- AI-Hybrid: 9 months
- AI-Native: 6 months

Benefits ramp up over 12 months starting from time-to-value milestone.
